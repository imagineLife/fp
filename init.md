A Fn (from set theory)
- a single-value collection of pairs
- input returns same output everytime


Functions have these one-word attributes
Total
- as opposed to a partial fn
- takes an input && returns an output
Deterministic
- always one input returning one output
No Observable Side-Effects


Props Args && Currying
Associative
- GROUPINGS of numbers is irrelevant
    - a + (b + c) same as (a+b) + c
Commutative
- ORDER is irrelevant
    - d * e * f same as f * d * e
Identity
- hmmm
- 
Distributive
* multiply a number by a group of numbers added together, or
* do each multiply separately then add them
    * ex 
        * 3 * 6 same as (3*2) + 3*4



Point-Free
- a function or part-of-code not KNOWING domain-specific content
    - client = `${firstName}-${lastName}`
    - COULD BE
    - mergedStr = `${a}-${b}`

Partial Application Vs Currying
Partial App
- giving a fn only some of its parameters
Currying
